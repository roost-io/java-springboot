# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Unprotected Sensitive Data Exposure - PCI (Payment Card Information)
# Issue: In each POST request log, card numbers are being directly exposed. This is a clear violation of PCI DSS. Exposed on log line numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
# Solution: All card numbers should be tokenized or hashed when stored in logs, to prevent exposure. Regularly check and update your data storage and handling policies to ensure PCI DSS compliance.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
# Issue: The requests made also have the potential to expose sensitive data if an attacker gains access. The resource (cardPaymentAuthenticationStatuses) seems to contain sensitive data and are directly referenced by their identifier. This means an attacker could potentially manipulate references to access unauthorized data.
# Solution: Do not expose direct references to sensitive data. Use other indirect ways of referencing objects such as using UID or even UUID for referencing data. For added security, each reference should also include authorization checks.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Non-compliance
# Issue: GDPR requires businesses to protect personal data in all states whether it be in transit, at rest or during processing. The current logs hold bare minimum GDPR compliance standards as personal card numbers are directly exposed. Log line numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
# Solution: Sensitive data must be protected at all times to adhere to GDPR standards. The usage of tokenization or encryption should be implemented while processing or storing sensitive data.
