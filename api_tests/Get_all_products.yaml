  - comment: "This scenario tests the 'Get All Products' API. A GET request is sent to '/products' and the response is validated to ensure it meets the expected criteria. The status code should be 200, indicating a successful operation. The response body should contain an array of products, each with properties like id, name, description, and price. However, based on the scenario objective, the list of products returned should be empty."
