  # This scenario tests the functionality of the 'Get all products' endpoint.
  # The expected behavior is that the server returns a 200 status code and an empty list of products.
  # This is because the scenario assumes that no products have been added to the database.
  # If the server returns a 200 status code and an empty list, it means that the endpoint is working as expected.
