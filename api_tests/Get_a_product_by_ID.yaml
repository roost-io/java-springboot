scenarios:
  - name: "Get a product by ID"
    flow:
      # Given there is an existing product with ID 1
      - get:
          url: "/products/1"
          headers:
            Content-Type: "application/json"
          expect:
            # Then the response status code should be 200
            - statusCode: 200
            # And the response should contain the product with ID 1
            - hasProperty: "id"
            - equals:
                id: 1

  # This scenario is designed to validate the endpoint that retrieves a product by its ID.
  # The expected behavior is that, given an existing product with a specific ID, when a GET request is sent to the endpoint, the response should have a status code of 200, and the response body should contain the product with the specified ID.

  # The test scenario is named "Get a product by ID" to reflect the action being tested (retrieving a product by its ID). The URL for the request is "/products/1", indicating that the product with ID 1 is being retrieved.

  # The headers for the request specify that the content type is "application/json", indicating that the request body and response are expected to be in JSON format.

  # The assertions in the "expect" block validate the response. The "statusCode" assertion checks that the status code of the response is 200, indicating a successful request. The "hasProperty" assertion checks that the response body has a property "id", ensuring that the product's ID is included in the response. The "equals" assertion checks that the value of the "id" property in the response body is 1, confirming that the correct product has been retrieved.
