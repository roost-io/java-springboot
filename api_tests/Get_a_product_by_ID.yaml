    # This scenario is expected to send a GET request to the "/products/1" endpoint and receive a 200 status code in response.
    # The response should contain a product object with an ID of 1, a name property, a description, and a price.
    # The exact values of the name, description, and price properties are not specified and are therefore not validated in this scenario.
