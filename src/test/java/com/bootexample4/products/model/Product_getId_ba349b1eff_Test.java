================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Disclosure (CWE-200)
Issue: The 'getId()' method is public and might be exposing sensitive data if ID is used as a sensitive piece of information. If unauthorized actors can access this method, they may be able to extract sensitive data or manipulate the system believing the provided ID.
Solution: 1. If the ID is not sensitive or proprietary information, you may not need to take any action. 2. If the ID is sensitive, consider adjusting the access level of this method or apply proper access controls. 3. Use security annotations or incorporate a security framework to manage role-based access to this method effectively. 4. Introduce layered architecture to separate concerns to improve security.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if getId() returns null 

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdReturnsNull
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getId() method returns null when the id field of the entity/model object is not set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the entity/model class without setting the id field.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the object.
    Assert: Assert that the result is null.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the getId() method returns null if the id field is not set. This is an important validation as it asymptotically reduces the chances of a NullPointerException.

  Scenario 2: Test to verify getId() returns a valid Long id

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdReturnsValidLongId
    Description: This test is meant to confirm that the getId() method properly returns a Long id when one is set on the entity/model object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the entity/model class and set a Long value for the id field.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the object.
    Assert: Assert that the result is the same as the Long id that was set.
  Validation: 
    This test confirms that the getId() method correctly returns the id of the object when it is set. This is an integral part of the business logic, as it ensures the correct id can be retrieved from the object for various operations.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if getId() returns the last set id

  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdReturnsLastSetId
    Description: This test is to check if getId() returns the latest id when the id field of the entity/model object is updated multiple times.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the entity/model class and set, then reset, the id field.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on the object.
    Assert: Assert that the result is the same as the last set id value.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getId() method always returns the current/latest id of the object. This is expected behavior and complying with it ensures the integrity and accuracy of data.

/* Comment:
The mentioned error [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.22.2:test (default-test) 
on project products: No tests were executed! (Set -DfailIfNoTests=false to ignore this error.) -> [Help 1]
[ERROR] implies that there were no tests executed during test phase, so focus should be
on test setup and not on business logic here.

Given test cases seem to be fine and they should work as expected assuming Class Under Test 'Product' 
and its method implementations are correct.
Ensure that the 'Product' class is properly located in the 'src/main/java' directory and it's structure is correct.
Also make sure to name the test class correctly, otherwise it will not be found during test execution phase.
Test class should be located in 'src/test/java' directory and should have the same package structure 
as the class under test 'Product' class.
If issue still persists check the test run configuration and test environment setup.
