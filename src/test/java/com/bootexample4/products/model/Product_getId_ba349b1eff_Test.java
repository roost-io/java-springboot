ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getId_ba349b1eff

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: The existing getId method is public, which makes it accessible from anywhere and may result in unauthorized access of 'id'.
Solution: Restrict the accessibility of the getId method. It is recommended to make it protected or package-private if there is no need for it to be public.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in Security Decision
Issue: No input validation is done in the getId method. If data provided to it is not trusted and not validated, it leads to several security issues such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Solution: Implement appropriate validation checks before using the data provided by the methods including getId. It's recommended to use a safe API which automatically performs such checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getId method directly returns a potentially sensitive data 'id', which may lead to the exposure of private information.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is not unnecessarily exposed and enhance data protection by using encapsulation. If necessary, apply a data masking technique to return masked data instead of the actual ID.

================================================================================
""" 
  Scenario 1: Fetch the 'Id' when it is already been assigned

  Details:  
    TestName: retrieveIniitializedId
    Description: The test will validate the getId() method's functionality to return the Id when it has been previously assigned.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a mock entity and assign an Id.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method in the mock entity.
    Assert: Check if the returned Id is the same as the one previously assigned to the entity.
  Validation: 
    The aim is to verify if the getId() method successfully retrieves the correct Id. This test scenario is important as Ids are used to identify unique entities and their correct retrieval is crucial for maintaining data integrity.
    
  Scenario 2: Fetch the 'Id' when there isn't anything assigned yet

  Details:  
    TestName: retrieveUninitializedId
    Description: The test will verify the behavior of getId() when no Id has been assigned.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a mock entity without assigning an Id.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method in the mock entity.
    Assert: Check if the returned Id is null.
  Validation: 
    The aim is to confirm that getId() correctly handles cases where an Id is not yet assigned. This is significant because the resilience of the software to null values forms a crucial part of error handling.
    
  Scenario 3: Check if the 'Id' returned is unique

  Details:  
    TestName: retrieveUniqueIds
    Description: This test will verify if getId() returns unique Ids for different entities.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize multiple mock entities and assign unique Ids.
    Act: Invoke the getId() method on each mock entity.
    Assert: Confirm that the returned Ids are unique.
  Validation: 
    It is aimed to verify the correct functionality of getId() in retrieving unique identifiers. This test scenario is important because Ensuring that the returned Ids are unique is crucial in maintaining the uniqueness of the entities in the persistence layer.
