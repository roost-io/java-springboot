================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unreachable Code - CWE-561
Issue: Your imported packages are not used anywhere and the method doesn't belong to any class. This can become misleading and increase the complexity of the code.
Solution: Remove unused imports and make sure methods are within classes.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test that GetDescription returns the correct description

Details:
  TestName: testGetDescriptionReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: The test is meant to ensure that the method getDescription correctly retrieves the value stored in the description field.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the entity class, and set its description field with a known value.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is equals to the known value that was initially set.

Validation:
  This test verifies that the getDescription method is correctly implemented, as it should return the exact value that is stored in the description field. A positive outcome would imply confidence in the getter method, and by extension, in the data retrieval from the entity class.

Scenario 2: Test that GetDescription returns null when the description is not set

Details:
  TestName: testGetDescriptionReturnsNullWhenNotSet
  Description: The test is intended to check that getDescription returns null if the description field has not been set.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an entity object without setting its description field.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.

Validation:
  This test confirms that getDescription rightly returns null when the description field is not set. This is crucial because in the context of a real usage scenario, this field might not always be set, hence the application should be able to handle such an occurrence gracefully.

Scenario 3: Test that GetDescription returns an empty string when the description is set as an empty string

Details:
  TestName: testGetDescriptionReturnsEmptyStringWhenSetAsEmpty
  Description: This test aims to confirm that getDescription returns an empty string when the description field is set as an empty string.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an entity object and set the description field as an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.

Validation:
  This test validates the ability of getDescription to correctly return an empty string when the description field is set as such. This is a plausible real-life scenario that can occur, and the code must be able to handle it correctly, thereby preventing any potential bugs arising from such a scenario.

// Comment on the compilation error
// No modification of the test cases is required, as the error message points to a failure during the test cases compilation (not execution). 
// The actual reason of the compilation error is not provided in details, thus it is hard to put a specific reason for the failure. 
// It could be a version mismatch, build path issue, failure in the dependencies resolution, etc.
