================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure and Leaking (CWE-200)
Issue: If this class contains sensitive data and includes getters and setters without any access control or validation, a user may gain unauthorized access to internal state or sensitive information stored in the class fields.
Solution: Avoid making sensitive data fields public and accessible without any security checks. Encapsulate the class fields and only allow access through getter and setter methods. Implement appropriate data validation and access control checks within these methods.

Vulnerability: Unrestricted Access to Object Fields (CWE-843)
Issue: If any field in this class were declared public, it would be directly accessible, allowing unauthorized modification. This could cause data integrity issues or unexpected behavior at runtime.
Solution: Adhere to encapsulation principles. Declare class fields as private and provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify them. Implement validation checks within these methods as needed.

"""
Scenario 1: Valid String Name Test

Details:  
TestName: validStringName
Description: This test is designed to check the getName() method's ability to return the correct name when called. 
Execution:
    Arrange: We do not require any setup for this test as getName()doesn't take any parameters, and doesn't depend on any other state or objects.
    Act: Call the getName() method.
    Assert: Confirm that the returned name is correct as per your expectation.
Validation: 
    This test verifies if method getName() is accurately returning the name it is supposed to. This is important as retrieving correct values is crucial for the application.

Scenario 2: Null String Name Test

Details:  
TestName: nullStringName
Description: This test is meant to confirm that the getName() method can handle null values correctly.
Execution:
    Arrange: Here, the setup is not required as getName() method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the getName() method.
    Assert: Validate that null is returned if the name was not set (or was set to null).
Validation: 
    This test ensures the method can handle null values correctly without throwing exceptions which may disrupt the application execution.

Scenario 3: Empty String Name Test

Details:  
TestName: emptyStringName
Description: Checking that getName() can handle empty names and returns an empty string without any error.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required here since getName() method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Call the getName() method.
    Assert: Ensure that an empty string is returned.
Validation: 
    The purpose of this test is to make sure that getName() handles empty strings smoothly and returns as expected, maintaining the application's stability.
  
Scenario 4: String Name with Spaces 

Details:
TestName: stringWithSpaces
Description: Proceed to verify that getName() handles strings with extra spaces.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required again as getName() does not take parameters.
    Act: Invoke getName() method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned string is stripped off extra spaces.
Validation: 
    This test ensures that if a string with leading, trailing, or extra spaces in between is not an issue and handled systematically by the getName() function."

Scenario 5: Long String Name Test

Details: 
TestName: longStringName
Description: This test is designed to ensure the getName() method can efficiently manage names that are very long.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data is required for getName() method.
    Act: Invoke getName() method.
    Assert: Check that the returned name is exactly the same as the long string input, irrespective of its length.
Validation: 
    In this validation, it confirms that the getName() function can handle long strings without trimming or throwing an error, ensuring the application's robustness and accuracy.

/*
All the test scenarios appear to be correct on their own. However, the error described in the error stack trace points towards the issue with missing dependencies in your project. The Product class required for testing is not found in the mentioned path.

The error message stated: "Could not find artifact com.bootexample4.products.model:Product:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT". This means it cannot locate the Product class which is being tested.

Also, the same error shows missing dependencies groupId1:artifactId1:jar:version1 and groupId2:artifactId2:jar:version2. These dependencies might be required for your application to function. Make sure all dependencies listed in your build.gradle or pom.xml files are available and can be downloaded. In absence of these, it is not possible to create the instance of the 'Product' class, making the test to fail.

Before running these tests, it's crucial to make sure that the 'Product' class is available and all the dependencies required for execution are correctly listed in your build configuration file and are available for download. Otherwise, none of the test scenarios will execute successfully due to these missing dependencies. Please fix the build dependencies to get the tests to run correctly.
