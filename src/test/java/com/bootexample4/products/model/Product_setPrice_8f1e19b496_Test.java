================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: The code might be part of a model that directly exposes an internal implementation object's reference to its clients. This could lead to unauthorized alteration of data.
Solution: Limit data exposure by using Data Transfer Objects(DTOs). Ensure the clients are only getting what they should have access to.

Vulnerability: Lack of input validation
Issue: Although not directly reflected in this piece of code, if the price is user-input, failing to validate or sanitize the input may lead to issues such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) etc.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user inputs. Use prepared statements for SQL queries to prevent SQL Injection.

Vulnerability: Insecure data storage
Issue: If sensitive data like credit card information is being stored without proper security measures, it poses a serious risk.
Solution: Never store sensitive data in plaintext. Always use strong encryption algorithms to store sensitive data.

================================================================================
""" 
Scenario 1: SetPrice with a positive value
TestName: setPricePositiveTest
Description: This test validates the functionality of the setPrice method when provided with a positive value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an entity object and set a price with any positive number.
  Act: Invoke setPrice method with this positive number.
  Assert: Check whether the price of the object has been set to the expected value using getter method (Assuming it exists).
Validation: 
  This test ensures that setPrice method correctly sets the price attribute of an object when positive value is provided. This is important because setting correct price is crucial for any e-commerce or trading application using this method.

Scenario 2: SetPrice with a zero value
TestName: setPriceZeroTest
Description: This test validates the functionality of the setPrice method when provided with a Zero value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an entity object and set a price with Zero.
  Act: Invoke setPrice method with Zero.
  Assert: Check whether the price of the object has been set to Zero using getter method(Assuming it exists).
Validation: 
  This test ensures that setPrice method correctly sets the price attribute of an object when a Zero value is provided. This is important as some products may be free of cost and should be handled by the application without misfunctioning.

Scenario 3: SetPrice with a negative value
TestName: setPriceNegativeTest
Description: This test validates the behavior of the setPrice method when provided with a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an entity object and set a price with a negative number.
  Act: Invoke setPrice method with this negative number.
  Assert: Check whether the price of the object has been not set to the negative number(using getter method) and stayed to its default or previous value.
Validation: 
  This test ensures that setPrice method rejects negative price values which is important because in real world scenarios price can't be negative.

Scenario 4: SetPrice with a really large value
TestName: setPriceHugeNumberTest
Description: This test validates the behavior of the setPrice method when provided with a very large number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an entity object and set a price with a very large number.
  Act: Invoke setPrice method with this large number.
  Assert: Check whether the price of the object has been set to the large number using getter method (Assuming it exists).
Validation:
  The test ensures that the setPrice method can handle price values that are significantly large. This is important to test as pricing can have large numbers especially in case of currency conversions or specific business contexts like real estate.
