================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-197: Numeric Truncation Error
Issue: The provided code does not validate if the passed price is a negative value. In financial calculations, negative values can cause serious calculation problems.
Solution: Recommend validating any numerical inputs like price to ensure it is within a realistic and expected range. For example: `if (price < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Price cannot be negative");`

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If this method were part of a web application, it could be vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References. This could occur if an attacker were able to directly manipulate parameters in order to modify data they are not authorized to access.
Solution: Ensure that proper access controls and permissions checks are implemented throughout the code base, particularly when directly accessing or modifying data based on user input.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Testing Correct Pricing Input
Details:  
  TestName: setPriceWithValidInput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method correctly assigns the provided valid input to the price variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as this is a simple setter method test.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a valid double value as the parameter.
  Assert: After setting the price, we'll use assertEqual to confirm if the price value has changed as expected.
Validation: 
  This validates that the simple setPrice method correctly assigns the value of price. It is crucial for ensuring accurate product price handling.

Scenario 2: Testing Negative Pricing Input
Details:  
  TestName: setPriceWithNegativeInput
  Description: This test will check how the setPrice method responds to a negative input. In a normal scenario, prices should not be negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Again, given the simplicity of this method, no exceptional arrangement is needed.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a negative double value as the parameter.
  Assert: After setting the price, use assertEqual to check if the price value accepts this negative value.
Validation: 
  This scenario helps us understand the behaviour of our method when faced with unusual but technically valid inputs. If the program accepts negative prices, we may need to review our setPrice method or adjust how product prices are handled elsewhere in the application.

Scenario 3: Testing Zero Price Input
Details:  
  TestName: setPriceWithZeroInput
  Description: This test is to check how the program handles a product price of zero, which logically can happen if an item is free.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement is necessary.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with 0 as the parameter.
  Assert: Use assertEqual to confirm if the price variable is indeed set to zero.
Validation: 
  Validating how our program handles a price of zero is important to ensure correct handling of free products, if they exist.

Scenario 4: Testing Maximum Double Value Pricing Input
Details:  
  TestName: setPriceWithMaxDoubleValue
  Description: This test will check how the setPrice method responds when the maximum possible double value is passed as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement is necessary.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with maximum possible double value as the parameter.
  Assert: Use assertEqual to confirm that the price variable is able to hold the large number that was input.
Validation: 
  This will help validate that setPrice can handle large numbers without returning errors or losing precision.

Scenario 5: Testing Minimum Double Value Pricing Input
Details:  
  TestName: setPriceWithMinDoubleValue
  Description: This test will check how the setPrice method responds when the minimum possible double value is passed as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special arrangement is necessary.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with minimum possible double value as the parameter.
  Assert: Use assertEqual to confirm that the price variable is able to hold the tiny number that was input.
Validation: 
  This will help validate that setPrice can handle very small numbers without returning errors or losing precision.
