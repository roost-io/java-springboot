================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No private access modifier for setDescription method
Issue: Without a private access modifier, the method can be accessed from outside the class. This can potentially allow unauthorized modification of class variables.
Solution: To potentially mitigate this vulnerability, you can declare the setDescription method as private. If the method needs to be accessed from outside the class, consider implementing control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access or modification.

Vulnerability: Inadequate data validation
Issue: The setDescription method doesn't perform input validation. This could lead to potential issues such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the value is used in database queries or dynamically added to web pages.
Solution: Consider adding appropriate input validation to the setDescription method to ensure the input is in an expected format. Use parameterized queries or sanitize the input before using it in a database query or adding it to a web page.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the correct assignment of description

Details:  
  TestName: testDescriptionAssignment.
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the description variable is correctly assigned using the setDescription method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the relevant class and define a string for the description.
  Act: Use the setDescription method to assign the description string to the class instance.
  Assert: AssertEquals between the set description string and the description variable of the class instance.
Validation: 
  This test verifies the basic functionality of the setDescription method, checking if the assignment of description is correctly performed. This test's significance is to ensure the basic operation of assigning the description is successful.

Scenario 2: Test to verify null value assignment 

Details:
  TestName: testNullValueAssignment.
  Description: This test is created to verify the behaviour of setDescription method when a null value is assigned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the relevant class and define a null string for the description.
  Act: Use the setDescription method to assign the null string to the class instance.
  Assert: AssertNull for checking the null assignment to the description variable of the class instance.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that setDescription method can handle null values. The importance of this test lies in ensuring that the class instance description variable can hold null values, as required.

Scenario 3: Test to verify update description 

Details:
  TestName: testUpdateDescription.
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behaviour of setDescription method when updating the description.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the relevant class and define a string for the description. Then using setDescription, assign the string to the class instance. Repeat with a new string. 
  Act: Use the setDescription method first to set the description value, and then to update it to a new value.
  Assert: AssertEquals between the new description string and the description variable of the class instance.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the setDescription method can update the description successfully. This is important for scenarios where description updates are required.

Scenario 4: Test with empty string assignment

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyStringAssignment.
  Description: This test is designed to verify the behaviour of setDescription when an empty string is assigned. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the relevant class and define an empty string for the description.
  Act: Use the setDescription method to assign the empty string to the class instance.
  Assert: AssertEquals between the empty string assigned and the description variable in the instance.
Validation: 
  This helps ensure that setDescription method performs as expected when empty strings are assigned to it.
