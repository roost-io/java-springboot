================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unsafe data exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The getPrice() method is returning a price value without any checks or encryption. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Implement necessary checks before returning this value. If necessary, use data encryption.

Vulnerability: Potential SQL/JPA Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: The code imports jakarta.persistence package which is used for Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) with databases. Some manipulation could lead to JPA/SQL Injection if query inputs are not properly sanitized.
Solution: Always make sure to use parameterized queries or sanitize the input to your queries. Do not construct queries using string concatenation.

Vulnerability: Missing class definition (CWE-912)
Issue: There is no class definition in this snippet. It could lead to NullPointerExceptions, issues with class inheritance or other vulnerabilities and logical errors.
Solution: Ensure that all necessary code elements (class definition, necessary variables and methods) are included and properly defined.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Verify correct price is returned

Details:  
  TestName: testCorrectPriceIsReturned
  Description: This test is used to validate that the getPrice method is returning the correct stored price. It carries out a basic function check of the getPrice method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class containing the getPrice method and set the price value to a known value.
  Act: Call the getPrice method from the created object's context.
  Assert: Check that the returned price is equal to the set value.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly accesses and returns the price of the object. If this test pass, it confirms that the basic function of the getPrice method works correctly.

Scenario 2: Verify default price is returned if no price is set

Details:  
  TestName: testDefaultPriceIsReturnedIfNotSet
  Description: This test validates that the getPrice method correctly returns a default price when no price has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class containing the getPrice method without setting a price value.
  Act: Call the getPrice method of the object.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 0 or a default defined price depending on the implementation.
Validation: 
  If a price has not been set to a product, the method should return a default price or 0. This test ensures that the getPrice method behaves as expected in such scenarios.

Scenario 3: Verify negative price is handled

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativePriceHandling
  Description: This test checks if the getPrice method correctly handles a scenario where a price is set to a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object of the class containing the getPrice method and set the price to a negative value.
  Act: Call the getPrice method from the object's context.
  Assert: Check that the returned price is not a negative value, and is handled as per the implementation rules.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method correctly handles negative price values. The expected behaviour in such cases is defined by business rules and system design, which can vary.
