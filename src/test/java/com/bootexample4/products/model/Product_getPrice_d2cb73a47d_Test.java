"""
  Scenario 1: Default Price Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetDefaultPrice
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method getPrice(). Specifically, the test should verify that initially, the method returns the default price value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary as the method does not rely on any input or external data
    Act: Invoke the method getPrice()
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned price is the expected default
  Validation: 
    Confirm the method returns the default price. This test's significance is to ensure that the default price value is correct.

  Scenario 2: Price Modification Test

  Details:
    TestName: testModifiedPrice
    Description: This test is meant to check if getPrice() reflects changes made to the price attribute. It checks the method in a scenario where the normal flow of setting a price and getting it is tested.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Set the price to a new value.
    Act: Invoke the method getPrice()
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price with the expected new value
  Validation: 
    Confirm the price retrieved aligns with the set price. This is important to ensure the price can be set and retrieved correctly.

  Scenario 3: Negative Value Test

  Details:
    TestName: testNegativeValuePrice
    Description: The test is supposed to check the getPrice() method's behavior if it is set to a negative value. 
  Execution:  
    Arrange: Set the price to a negative value.
    Act: Invoke the method getPrice()
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price with the expected outcome. Depending on how the setPrice() method is implemented, it may return the negative value, or it may return the default price (if negative values are not accepted).
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if negative values are handled correctly. This test ensures that even in unintended usage scenarios, the method works as expected without causing vulnerabilities or inconsistencies. 

  Scenario 4: Test with Maximum Boundary Value

  Details:
    TestName: testMaxBoundaryPrice
    Description: This test checks the functionality of the getPrice() method with the maximum possible boundary condition for the double data type.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the price to the maximum possible value allowed for a double. 
    Act: Invoke the method getPrice()
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned price with the maximum double value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getter handles the maximum boundary condition properly. This test is crucial to ensure that the method can handle extreme cases properly.
