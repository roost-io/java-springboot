Test generated by RoostGPT for test divyesh-java using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test Scenario: Validate the basic functionality of the `getPrice` method.
   Expected Result: The `getPrice` method should return the price of the object.

2. Test Scenario: Validate the case where the `price` data member has not been initialized. 
   Expected Result: `getPrice` method should return the default value of double which is 0.0 since `price` is uninitialized.

3. Test Scenario: Validate when the price is set to a positive value.
   Expected Result: The `getPrice` method should return the same positive value.

4. Test Scenario: Validate when the price is set to a negative value.
   Expected Result: The `getPrice` method should return the same negative value.

5. Test Scenario: Validate the case where the `price` data member has been set to the maximum value manageable by a double type data.
   Expected Result: The `getPrice` method should return the maximum double value.

6. Test Scenario: Validate the case where the `price` data member has been set to the minimum value manageable by a double type data.
   Expected Result: The `getPrice` method should return the minimum double value.

7. Test Scenario: Test the persistence of the `price` data member value through different object state changes.
   Expected Result: The `getPrice` method should always return the current `price` data member value regardless of object state changes.

8. Test Scenario: Validate concurrency access to getPrice.
   Expected Result: `getPrice` should handle concurrent requests effectively, returning the correct price in all instances.

9. Test Scenario: Validate getPrice after price has been updated.
   Expected Result: `getPrice` should return the updated price after it has been changed. 

10. Test Scenario: Validate getPrice method with fractional price values.
    Expected Result: `getPrice` should return the exact fractional value as set in the price.
