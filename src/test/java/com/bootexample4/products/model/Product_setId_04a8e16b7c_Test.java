Sure, here are some high-level test scenarios to validate the setId function:

1. **Positive Scenario**: Set a valid non-null Long value to id
   - In this scenario, we should set an id using the `setId()` method with a valid non-null Long value and then, the id of the object should be updated.

2. **Null Input Scenario**: Set null value to id
   - Here, we should set an id using the `setId()` method with null and then, it should be verified that either the id of the object is set to null without error, or an appropriate exception is thrown, depending on the expected behavior.

3. **Negative Value Scenario**: Set negative Long value to id
   - Set an id using the `setId()` method with a negative Long value, then verify the id of the object. The expected result might be that the negative id value is accepted or an error or exception is thrown, depending on business rules.

4. **Zero Value Scenario**: Set zero Long value to id
   - This involves setting an id as zero using the `setId()` method and then verifying the id of the object. Check if id of zero is allowable or if an error or exception occurs.

5. **Large Value Scenario**: Check the maximum limit of Long
   - This involves passing the maximum long value possible to `setId()`. It is important to understand how the system handles edge cases.

6. **Thread-Safety Scenario**: Multiple Set calls in multithreaded environment
   - This scenario involves invoking `setId()` simultaneously from multiple threads. The aim would be to check the thread-safety of method. It might not be necessary for all applications, but it's important if the function is expected to be used in a multithreaded environment.

7. **Persistence Scenario**: Check if the set ID is persisting properly
   - After using `setId()` method to set an id, persist the entity and retrieve it again to ensure the set id value is retained.

For test scenarios 2, 3 and 4, it depends entirely on the expected behavior of the system. Business rules and program specifications should give an insight into what to expect.
