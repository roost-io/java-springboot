ROOST_METHOD_HASH=setId_b802c080bf
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=setId_04a8e16b7c

Scenario 1: Regular Scenario with positive valid ID
Details:  
  TestName: testSetIdWithPositiveNumber.
  Description: This test is designed to check the normal operation of the setId() method when provided with a positive, valid number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate Object. Suppose id value is 10.
  Act: Invoke setId() method with the value 10. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  Assert that the ID has been correctly set through the setId() method. This test verifies that setId() correctly processes positive, valid numerical id values.

Scenario 2: Scenario with negative ID
Details:  
  TestName: testSetIdWithNegativeNumber.
  Description: This test is designed to check the behaviour of the setId() method when issued with a negative number. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate Object. Suppose id value is -10.
  Act: Invoke setId() method with the negative value. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  Assert that the ID should not be set as ID couldn't be a negative number. This tests that setId() appropriately prevents invalid id values and handles failure.

Scenario 3: Null ID Scenario
Details:  
  TestName: testSetIdWithNullValue.
  Description: This test is designed to check the behaviour of the setId() method when issued a null input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate Object. 
  Act: Invoke setId() method with a null argument. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure a NullPointerException is thrown when a null argument is passed.
Validation: 
  Assert that Null pointer exception has been thrown. This test verifies that setId() correctly throws an exception when given a null value.

Scenario 4: Scenario with zero ID
Details:  
  TestName: testSetIdWithZero.
  Description: The test aims to establish that the setId() method functions properly when set to Zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate Object. Suppose id value is 0. 
  Act: Invoke setId() method with the value 0.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  Assert that the ID has been set as zero through the setId() method. This test verifies that setId() correctly processes zero value as it is a valid id value.
