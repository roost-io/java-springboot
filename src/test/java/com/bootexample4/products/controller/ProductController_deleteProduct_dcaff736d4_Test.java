Test generated by RoostGPT for test dm-demo-unit using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

1. Test Scenario if Given Product Id is Valid:
   - Description: Test the function with a valid product id that exists in the product repository.
   - Input: A valid product id that exists in the product repository.
   - Expected output: Product is deleted successfully and the function returns a 200 OK response.

2. Test Scenario if Given Product Id is Invalid:
   - Description: Test the function with an invalid product id that doesn't exist in the product repository.
   - Input: An invalid product id that doesn't exist in the product repository.
   - Expected output: The function returns a 404 Not Found response.

3. Test Scenario for Id as Null:
   - Description: Test the delete product function with a null id.
   - Input: Null id.
   - Expected output: The function should return an error or a 400 Bad Request response.

4. Test Scenario for Deletion of Already Deleted Product:
   - Description: Test the function with a product id that was already deleted from the product repository.
   - Input: A product id that was previously deleted from the product repository.
   - Expected output: The function returns a 404 Not Found response.

5. Test Scenario for Empty Repository:
   - Description: Test the function when the product repository is empty.
   - Input: Any product id.
   - Expected output: The function returns a 404 Not Found response.

6. Test Scenario with multiple products in the repository.
   - Description: Test the function when there are multiple products in the repository.
   - Input: A valid product id that exists in the repository.
   - Expected output: The specified product is deleted and the function returns a 200 OK response.

7. Test Scenario for Large Product Ids:
   - Description: Test the function with product ids that are very large and could potentially cause overflow issues.
   - Input: A very large product id.
   - Expected output: Depending on the implementation, the function should either handle the large id properly and return the appropriate response or throw an error.
   
8. Test Scenario for Deleting a Product that is In Use or Reserved:
   - Description: Test the delete product function with a product that is currently in use or reserved.
   - Input: A product id that is currently in use or reserved.
   - Expected output: Depending on the business logic, this should either disallow the deletion and return an appropriate error message or delete the product and return a 200 OK response.
   
This largely covers most of the real-world scenarios you may face while deploying this function.
