================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If the 'id' parameter can be externally controlled, it could be exploited to perform SQL injection attacks. Consequences may include unauthorized read, modification, or deletion of data in your database.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries or ORM libraries to prevent SQL injection. Avoid using direct 'id' user inputs in SQL queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled resource consumption
Issue: The JpaRepository method 'findById' is used, which might lead to excess memory or CPU usage if the 'id' is manipulated by an attacker to return a large number of records
Solution: Put limits on the number of records returned from a single request to protect against resource exhaustion attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-213: Intentional Exposure of Information Through Sent Data
Issue: Returning stack traces directly to the users can be a security risk as it can expose sensitive information.
Solution: Implement proper exception handling and logging. Do not expose detailed system-level details to the user.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Deletion of Existing Product

Details:  
  TestName: testValidProductDeletion.
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the method correctly deletes a product when a valid product id is given.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mimic of ProductRepository and a valid product with a unique ID. Method findById should return the product.
    Act: Call deleteProduct method with the valid product's ID.
    Assert: Assert that the response is ResponseEntity.ok().
  Validation: 
    This test validates the delete functionality. The expected result is a successful HTTP response because the product exists in the repository. The test demonstrates that the application can successfully delete an existing product.

Scenario 2: Attempted Deletion of Non-Existing Product

Details:
  TestName: testNonExistentProductDeletion.
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the method when it attempts to delete a product that does not exist in the repository.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mimic of ProductRepository. The method findById should return null or empty.
    Act: Call deleteProduct method with a non-existent product ID.
    Assert: Assert that the response is ResponseEntity.notFound().
  Validation: 
    This test validates the handling of non-existent products. The expected result is a "NotFound" HTTP response because the product does not exist. The test verifies that the application appropriately handles errors and returns a not found response.

Scenario 3: Handling of null Product ID

Details:
  TestName: testNullProductIdDeletion.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles a null input for the product id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed.
    Act: Call deleteProduct method with a null ID.
    Assert: Assert that an Exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that the method can effectively handle null inputs to prevent NullPointerExceptions. The expected result is an Exception, ensuring that the application avoids crashes caused by null values.
    
Scenario 4: Negative Product ID Deletion Test

Details:
  TestName: testNegativeProductIdDeletion.
  Description: This test verifies the method's behavior when attempting to delete a product with a negative ID.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The method findById should return null or empty.
    Act: Call deleteProduct with a negative product ID.
    Assert: Assert that the response is ResponseEntity.notFound().
  Validation: 
    This test aims to validate the method's error handling when dealing with invalid ID inputs. No product should have a negative ID, so the expected result is a "NotFound" HTTP response. This test verifies the application's ability to handle invalid inputs correctly.
