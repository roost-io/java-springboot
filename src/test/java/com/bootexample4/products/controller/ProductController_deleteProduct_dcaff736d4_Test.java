Test Scenario 1: Happy Path Scenario
    - When a product with a valid ID that exists in the product repository is deleted.
    Expected Behavior: The function should delete the product successfully from the repository and a successful response (200 OK) should be returned.

Test Scenario 2: Product Not Found
    - When a product with a valid ID that does not exist in the product repository is tried to delete.
    Expected Behavior: The function should not perform any deletion and a not found response (404 Not Found) should be returned.

Test Scenario 3: Invalid Product ID
    - When a delete operation is tried with an invalid product ID.
    Expected Behavior: The function should not perform any deletion and should generate an error.

Test Scenario 4: Null Product ID
    - When a delete operation is attempted with a null product ID.
    Expected Behavior: The function should not perform any deletion and should generate an error.

Test Scenario 5: Constraint Violation
    - When a delete operation is tried on a product ID that has dependencies in the system, violating constraint checks.
    Expected Behavior: The function should not perform any deletion and should generate a constraint violation error.

Test Scenario 6: Performance Testing
    - When a delete operation is attempted on a large-scale product data.
    Expected Behavior: The operation should be completed within the defined tolerance limits for performance measure.

Test Scenario 7: Simultaneous Deletion Issues
    - When two clients attempt to delete the same product at about the same time.
    Expected Behavior: One request should successfully delete the product and return a successful response. The other request should fail to delete (as the product no longer exists), returning a not found response.
