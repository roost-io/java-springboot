================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: IDOR - Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: The function deleteProduct seems to delete a product based on an ID provided by the client. A malicious user might try to guess or retrieve other product IDs and delete them.
Solution: Implement proper access control checks to ensure that the authenticated user has the appropriate privilege to delete the product. This can often be achieved using role based access controls.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: There is no input validation on the id parameter of the deleteProduct function. This might lead to type mismatch attacks, or attacks that involve special IDs (like -1, 0, etc.).
Solution: Add code to check if the input parameter id is valid. It might be as simple as checking if id is a positive integer or as complex as checking if there exists a product with such ID in the first place.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Id of an existing product

Details:  
  TestName: testDeleteExistingProduct
  Description: The test checks whether the deleteProduct method removes an existing product from the product repository in the database successfully. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock product and add it to the database. 
  Act: Call the deleteProduct method with the ID of the mock product.
  Assert: Check if the product with the same ID does not exist in the productRepository.
Validation: 
  Verify that the product has been deleted from the repository and the HTTP status code 200 (OK) is returned. The test is critical to ensuring that the delete function works correctly with valid input data.

Scenario 2: Invalid Id of a non-existing product

Details: 
  TestName: testDeleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: The test validates the system's response when attempting to delete a product that does not exist in the product repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: There's no need to set up any product data as we are simulating a situation where there's no product with the given ID.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with an ID that does not exist in the productRepository.
  Assert: Assert that the output of the method is the HTTP status code 404 (Not Found).
Validation: 
  Validate that the method responds correctly with HTTP status code 404 (Not Found) when trying to delete a non-existing product. The significance of the test is to ensure that the delete function handles invalid product IDs gracefully.
  
Scenario 3: Negative Id value

Details: 
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithNegativeId
  Description: The test checks the behavior of the deleteProduct method when a negative ID value is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: There's no need to set up any product data as negative IDs are typically invalid.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a negative ID value.
  Assert: Assert that the output of the method is the HTTP status code 404 (Not Found).
Validation: 
  The test aims to confirm that the deleteProduct method handles negative IDs correctly, i.e., it does not delete any product and returns HTTP status code 404 (Not Found). The test is crucial to ensure that the deletion process cannot be carried out with negative ID values.
