================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-566: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
Issue: This issue is manifested when a user is able to modify key values that are directly used in security checks, thereby bypassing these checks. In the given code, the product object coming from the API endpoint is saved directly to the database allowing a sophisticated user to modify its values before it's persisted.
Solution: It is recommended to have a server-side validation mechanism for every field sent in the request. This can be achieved by using validation annotations in your entity classes and using a BindingResult object to check errors in your controller actions.

Vulnerability: CWE-943: Incomplete Verification of Data Authenticity
Issue: An attacker can inject any fields in the JSON data inside the @RequestBody and these fields would silently pass and save into the database if those fields match with fields in the server-side object.
Solution: Use DTO(Data Transfer Object) instead of directly using the Entity. So fields, that are not included in DTO, cannot be passed from request body.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: Given code does not contain any CSRF protection mechanism in place. A CSRF attack tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request.
Solution: Spring Security provides built-in CSRF protection mechanism. Enable CSRF protection in the SecurityConfig class of your application.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when the product repository successfully creates a new product
Details:
    TestName: testProductCreationWithValidProduct
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the product creation method works as expected with a valid product.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock product with valid values using Mockito.
    Act: Call the createProduct method of the productRepository with the mock product.
    Assert: Ensure that the returned product is not null and it matches the mock product using JUnit assertions.
Validation: 
    The expected result is to check the successful creation of a new product using valid product data. The given business logic to implement is the product creation functionality.

Scenario 2: Test when the product repository fails to create a new product
Details:
    TestName: testProductCreationWithNullProduct
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check how the product creation method handles a scenario when the product is null.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null product using Mockito.
    Act: Call the createProduct method of the productRepository with the null product.
    Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown using JUnit assertions.
Validation: 
    The expected result is that the program handles null scenarios properly by throwing an exception. This checks how the program handles error scenarios in business logic.

Scenario 3: Test Products with Invalid Values
Details:  
    TestName: testProductCreationWithInvalidData
    Description: This test is meant to check how the Product creation method handles Products with invalid values.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock Product with invalid values using Mockito. 
    Act: Call the createProduct method of the ProductRepository with the invalid Product.
    Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown using JUnit assertions.
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify how the program handles invalid data scenarios by throwing an exception. This checks how the program handles error scenarios in business logic.

Scenario 4: Test the creation of multiple valid products
Details:  
    TestName: testMultipleProductCreationWithValidProducts
    Description: This test is designed to verify the successful creation of multiple valid products.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create multiple mock Products with valid values using Mockito. 
    Act: Call the createProduct method of the ProductRepository with the mock Products in a loop.
    Assert: Ensure that each returned product is not null and matches the corresponding mock Product using JUnit assertions.
Validation: 
    The assertion verifies the successful creation of multiple valid products, which demonstrates the application's ability to handle multiple product creation scenarios in the business logic.
